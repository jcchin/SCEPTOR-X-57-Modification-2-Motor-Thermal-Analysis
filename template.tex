\begin{abstract}

This work covers the refinement of thermal models from design estimates to actual fabricated performance. Matching the experimental data of the first fully electrified version of the X-57 Maxwell experimental vehicle requires high fidelity thermal analysis to sufficiently capture the electric motor and inverter temperature profiles. Qualification test data of the motors and inverters is used to validate finite element analysis models, which are then used to predict thermal performance over various notional mission transients. An additional thermal-hydraulic models is used to estimate flow characteristics through the propulsor nacelle and component heat sinks. After calibration of the higher order models, overall component sizing and peak temperature constraints can be distilled to reduced order models, to improve model flexibility and utility.

\section{Introduction}

The NASA X-57 experimental aircraft aims to demonstrate all-electric flight, specifically using distributed electric propulsion to achieve 4.8x better efficiency at cruise. The development is segmented into 4 distinct vehicle configurations, referred to as "mods". Mod 2 uses a modified Tecnam P2006T fuselage and wing, with the inboard propellers powered by electric motors and batteries. After successful flight in this configuration, the propellors are moved to the wingtips, and the wing area is reduced by a factor of 2.5 using high-aspect area wings in Mod 3. The final Mod 4 configuration implements six small high lift motors along each wing to provide additional lift during climb and final approach, while being folded conformal to the nacelle during cruise. \cite{falck_X57}
\cite{Borer_2016}

This work covers the refinement of thermal models from design estimates to actual fabricated performance. The motor and inverters were manufactured by Joby motors and have been ground tested at NASA Armstrong. Testing was performed on the AirVolt test stand as part of qualification testing, with the secondary intent of verifying thermal models. To further validate efficiency estimates, the motors are undergoing further testing on a dynamo-meter in a more controlled thermal environment.

\subsection{Experimental Setup}
\subsubsection{AirVolt Test Stand and Experimental Setup}

AirVolt is an open-air test stand located at NASA's Armstrong Flight Research Center designed for testing electric motors and controllers.\cite{Aamod_2015} Before flight, the cruise motors are subjected to endurance and vibration testing per FAR Part 33 Airworthiness Standards. The stand measures torque, thrust, voltage, current, power, acceleration, and temperature. Full power tests up to 5 minutes were run, with 16 thermistor locations on the motor. Due to a maximum allowable temperature of 100 degrees C, portable cooling carts were used to blow up to 600 lbs/min of 8 \degree C air directly onto the propeller spinner. 

The test run had the hub cone spinner installed with 3 cooling carts, torque of 255 N-m, RPM of 2250. Each run started at 27C winding temperature and terminated at 100C. The first run lasted 21:06 minutes, 6:53, 6:37, 4:28.

	\label{fig:airvolt2}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Motor Sensor Installation}
A negative temperature coefficient (NTC) thermistor was installed every fourth coil during the motor manufacturing process. The sensor is inserted between the coils and stator yolk at the most radially inward accessible location of the slot. The sensors were installed after the teeth laminations were assembled but before motor winding. Unfortunately in hindsight, this resulted in inconsistent readings as some sensors were influenced more by the steel than the coil windings. After coiling, the stator windings were then potted with a low viscosity wicking epoxy. The intended purpose of this epoxy is to secure the windings against movement and vibration, and to provide a good thermal path to the steel laminations. However, the slot is intentionally not entirely filled to save mass. This further exacerbates the variability in the NTC sensor thermal mounting depending on the level of thermal contact.

The following sections summarize of the relevant thermal results obtained. Efficiency of the controllers and motors are surmised based on operating voltage, current, and temperature rise of the system. Heat generation in the motor is split between various parts of the stator and rotor, so the percentage of heat through each component must be estimated. Additional confounding factors including ambient cooling, and spinner induced flow must also be considered. To determine efficiency, a high-fidelity COMSOL model of the motor was created to determine the temperature distribution within each subcomponent and calibrated against multiple installed thermocouple locations. A transient execution is performed then calibrated against test data to compensate for uncontrolled cooling.


\subsubsection{Data Analysis}

Test data on Airvolt was sampled at 60 samples per second, however the provided raw thermistor data was not calibrated, since it was not the main focus of the trial run. Therefore, each sensor values were individually offset to the mean temperature reading before the motor was run. A large spread in peak temperature was recorded across various winding positions, so the peak model temperature was calibrated against the peak recorded thermistor reading. Temperature readings drastically below the peak reading were assumed to have poor thermal contact with the windings. The highest temperature reading also appeared to have substantial EMI noise, so the data was smoothed via a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) in Matlab.

\setminted{fontsize=\small,baselinestretch=1}
\begin{minted}{matlab}
alpha = 0.1; % tune-able parameter 
data(2:n-1) = alpha*data(2:n-1) + (1-alpha)*0.5*(data(1:n-2)+data(3:n)) % clip symmetrically
f = fft(data) % take Fast Fourier Transform
f(n/2+1-20:n/2+20) = zeros(40,1); % remove high frequency content
smoothed_data = real(ifft(f)) % revert back to time domain, ignore small complex noise
\end{minted}

In this implementation, alpha is a tune-able parameter, with the 20 highest frequencies cut out symmetrically. Only the real component of the inverse FFT is copied, since any imaginary component only exists due to rounding precision.

\section{Thermal Modeling}

\subsection{Finite Element Thermal Model}

A Finite Element Analysis thermal model was built in COMSOL to calculate the heat distribution in the motor stator. To improve simulation speed, an axi-symmetric cut of the stator was simulated. The thermal losses in the rotor were determined to be a much smaller concern, and there is no experimental test data for the rotor regardless. The stator was reduced to a 30 degree slice to improve compute time, while maintaining the relevant structural members. The model includes the main aluminum support trusses and heat sink fins, iron stator laminations, copper windings, and Nomex slot liners. The model is driven transiently to match the power profile of the AirVolt tests, and thermal convection terms are calibrated until the temperature profiles match. (11/29/17)

Using a steady-state model a range of airspeeds and motor efficiencies are run in a design of experiments. To improve simulation speed, the model is further simplified to a 2D slice of the stator at the center of the coil. A polynomial is then fit through all the cases where the steady state is 100C to determine a trend-line of losses based on airspeed.
Next a transient model is run for three different points from the trend-line calculated, this data is then compared against a separate AirVolt test that didn't have any active air cooling. The transient test was compared to the uncooled test data since it was closer to adiabatic temperature rise, without cooling airflow as an additional confounding factor. Based on the three computed heat rise rates, a specific airspeed and loss combination will match the temperature rise per time $(\frac{dT}{dt})$ of the experimental data.

When using a 2D model, the data was best fit with a motor efficiency of 94\% and 25 $\frac{m}{s}$ cooling flow. Expanding the model back to a full 3D slice resulted in a noticeably higher heat capacity and final steady-state temperature. To match the initial temperature rise, the motor

\subsubsection{Model Parameter Sensitivity}


\subsection{Thermal Hydraulic Flow Model}

The Cruise propulsion system as installed in the Mod 2 vehicle consists of a single JMX57 motor driven by a pair of Cruise Motor Controller (CMCs).  The CMC location within the Mod 2 nacelle rules out the use of independent cooling air paths for the motor and controllers.  

(nacelle images here)

Cruise propulsion cooling is achieved with a combined flow path (“cascaded” cooling) that passes sequentially both the motor and CMC fin rows.  The nacelle inlet is split into a pair of concentric annuli - the innermost directly supplies the JMX57 motor with cool air, while the outer annulus directly charges the nacelle interior volume.  Warm air exhausted by the motor mixes with the bypass air, and continues through the motor controller (CMC) duct before being vented overboard.  
This configuration differs from the proposed Mod 3 and Mod 4 cruise design with the inclusion of the bypass or “motor gap” inlet.  The proposed gap width is meant to provide clearance to the spinning outer diameter of the JMX57, an out-runner motor while still conforming to a nacelle outer mold line similar to the stock Tecnam p2006t aircraft. 
A concern raised during the evaluation of this ‘cascade’ cooling system (as applied to the Mod 2 nacelle) is the potential for air to bypass the JMX57 cooling fins in favor of the ‘gap’ inlet, resulting in a reduction in cooler performance for the highest power density component in the cruise assembly.  
To better understand the interaction between the design parameters of the Mod 2 nacelle flow path, a combined thermal-hydraulic model was created in CRTech Sinaps, a visual modeling tool for SINDA/FLUINT thermo-hydraulic networks. 

\begin{figure}[!htb]% order of placement preference: here, top, bottom
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.75\textwidth]{figures/sinaps_paramsweep.PNG}
	\caption{Mod 2 Cruise Nacelle Flow Network in CRTech Sinaps}
	\label{fig:Sinaps}
\end{figure}

The flow network consists of boundary, plenum and connector fluid lumps.  Boundary lumps are defined by their respective static temperature and pressure, while plena are defined by their volume.  Fluid connections between lumps are defined by their length, hydraulic diameter, and flow area.  The steady state-flow is solved with a single-phase correlation model build into Sinda/FLUINT – a Darcy-Weisbach solution based a friction factor derived from a numerically smooth representation of the Moody Chart  (Darcy-Weisbach friction factor vs. Reynolds Number)\textbf{(cite crtech 2013 appendix A1)}).  A multiplication factor is used to represent multiple parallel, identical flow connectors (i.e. a parallel channel heat sink).  Specific flow connection parameters (hydraulic diameter, length, and area) were derived from CAD models provided of the Mod 2 nacelle, the JMX57 cooling fins, and an extruded fin profile selected for the CMC cooler.  

Each heat-dissipating component (JMX57 motor, CMC) was modeled using lumped parameters with a bulk specific heat (J/K) and thermal power dissipation.  The heat sources are coupled to the fluid network via forced convection ties.  Each tie is related to one or more fluid connectors to provide input parameters for the internal convection correlation appropriate for the flow solution.  A simple isothermal Nusselt number correlation (where Nu = 3.66) is used for low Reynolds number fluid paths, while turbulent convection coefficients are found via the Dittus-Boelter correlation. (CRtech manual and convective heat transfer reference).  Transitional Reynolds number flows (2000 < Re < 4600) are modeled with Hausen’s transition correlation. \cite{Kays}


\subsection{Nacelle Gap Design Sweep}

Through testing, it was discovered that the motor heated up to it's maximum operational temperature faster than expected. Although the inverters did not experience high temperatures on the static test stand, the final configuration will expose the inverter heat sink to hot motor exhaust. This motivated a design study to determine the optimal spacing between the nacelle fairing and motor outer diameter to guarantee sufficient cooling for the inverters.

\begin{figure}[!htb]% order of placement preference: here, top, bottom
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=.75\textwidth]{figures/gapsweep_results.png}
	\caption{Inverter Temperature Sensitivity to Fairing Gap Height}
	\label{fig:GapSweep}
\end{figure}

While the nacelle gap study is not predictive of actual component temperatures – as this requires higher fidelity conjugate heat transfer modeling.  Rather, the resulting steady lump temperatures are used to evaluate the overall cooling system performance sensitivity to the swept design parameters – specifically the “gap” inlet width.  Inlet conditions for the “gap inlet” study were chosen as a pessimistic  
A design sweep was conducted on the Mod 2 thermo-hydraulic network – focusing specifically on the sensitivity of motor and CMC operating temperatures to changes in the “gap” inlet size.  
The results of this sweep show little sensitivity in motor cooling performance to the size of the “gap” inlet – suggesting that the driving flow restriction in the network is downstream of the JMX57.  Of particular significance is the response of the CMC steady temperatures with increasing gap size:  increasing the volume of air that bypasses the motor results in lower operating temperatures for the CMCs without sacrificing motor cooling performance.  This effect diminishes past the nominal Mod 2 gap size of $\frac{3}{8}"$, but could be adapted to other X57 vehicle configurations (Mods 3 and 4) with little risk of compromising motor cooling. 


\subsection{Two-dimensional performance and loss model}

The original motor design by Joby \cite{Dubois2016} estimated the efficiency of the motor for a range of rpms and torque settings as shown in figure \ref{fig:map}. This performance map is compared against a similar fidelity model developed in MotorSolve. Finally efficiency points from AirVolt testing provide a third comparison point showing achieved performance with uncertainty from measured quantities.

\end{figure}


A 2D FEA simulation of the motor was made using Comsol Multiphysics rotating machinery module in order to establish initial loss predictions. The FEA model was used to determine static torque vs current curves for the motor and the magnetic field in all components vs rotor position at nominal operating conditions. The magnetic field data was post processed to predict stator core loss, wire proximity loss, and eddy current loss in the magnets. Mechanical windage and bearing losses were also calculated. These losses were than used to scale the required torque and thereby the required current so that shaft power was maintain. Resistive losses were then predicted using this scaled up current. The models used for these loss calculations will be discussed in the following sections. An example result from the FEA model can be seen in Figure X. Material properties used in this analysis are available in Table X.

	\caption{}
	\label{fig:motorSolve}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Stator Core Loss}
Stator core loss was predicted using the Improved Generalized Stienmetz Equation (IGSE) with minor loop separation method found in Reference 1. The IGSE is a modification to the Stienmetz Equation that allows for accurate prediction of core loss when the magnetic field is not sinusoidal. The Stienmetz Equation defines the specific core loss (loss per Kg of material) in electrical steel subjected to a sinusoidal varying magnetic field as

\begin{equation}
P_{v} = k*f^{alpha}B^{\beta}
\label{eq:CoreLoss}
\end{equation}

Where $P_v$ is specific core loss, f is the frequency of the sinusoidal varying magnetic field, B is the peak value of the field, 
and $k$, $\alpha$, and $\beta$ are material constants. $k$, $\alpha$, and $\beta$  
can generally be determined from core loss information provided by electrical steel manufacturers. 
Estimates of these constants for the JNEX900 laminated electrical steel used in SCEPTORs wing tip motors can be found in Table X. 
These estimates were made using charts found in Ref 2. The IGSE uses these parameters to predict core loss for non-sinusoidal waves as


\begin{equation}
P_{v} = \frac{1}{T}\int_{0}^{T}k_{1}|\frac{dB}{dt}|^{\alpha}(\Delta B)^{\beta-\alpha}dt
\label{eq:CoreLoss2}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
k_{1} = \frac{k}{2^{\beta-1}\pi^{\alpha-1}}\int_{0}^{2\pi}|cos(\Theta)|^{\alpha}d\theta
\label{eq:CoreLoss2}
\end{equation}

Where T is the period of repetition of the field in the core, $\Delta B$ is the peak to peak flux density, and $k_{1}$ is an updated loss coefficient. The algorithm for numerical implementing of this equation with minor loop separation is discussed in detail in Reference 1. This algorithm was implemented on the magnetic field vs rotor position data from the COMSOL simulation with time normalized so that core loss at any rotational speed can be estimate by

\begin{equation}
Loss_{core} = 0.2157*f_{elec}^{\alpha}
\label{eq:CoreLoss3}
\end{equation}

Where $Loss_{core}$ is the core loss in the motor and $f_{elec}$ is the electrical frequency of the motor at a given rotational speed. At nominal motor operating conditions (2250 RPM) this predicts 966 watts of core loss. 

This loss prediction is only meant to serve as a min baseline for core loss in the motor as the IGSE most likely under predicts the core losses. The IGSE is only accurate for unidirectional fields and therefore it doesn’t account for the losses from the rotating fields in the stator tooth tips and the corners of the connection between the stator teeth and the stator back Iron (Ref 3). Additionally this loss estimate did not account for the effects of the pulse width modulation used to produce sinusoidal stator current. Therefore Iron Core loss is the most likely location that additionally losses need to be added based on the thermal behavior of the motor. 
\subsubsection{Eddy Currents in Magnets}
Eddy currents in the Magnets where predicted using the eddy current model for general periodic waves found in Ref 4. The model defines volumetric loss in a component experiencing a periodically varying magnetic field as 

\begin{equation}
P_{c} = \frac{d^2}{3*pi*\rho}\frac{1}{T}\int_{0}^{T}(\frac{dB}{dt})dt
\label{eq:EddyLoss}
\end{equation}

Where $P_{c}$ is the volumetric loss, d is the thickness of the component in the direction perpendicular to the field, and $\rho$ is the resistivity of the material. This equation was applied to the magnetic field vs rotor position data with time normalized so that eddy current loss in the magnets at any rotational speed can be estimate by 
\begin{equation}
Loss_{mag} = 0.0010276*f_{elec}^{2}
\label{eq:EddyLoss2}
\end{equation}

Where $Loss_{mag}$ is the total loss in the magnets. At nominal motor operating conditions this predicts 578 watts of eddy current loss.

\subsubsection{Eddy Currents In Windings}
Eddy currents in the windings were calculated using the same equation as for the eddy currents in the magnets but with an updated coefficient so that

\begin{equation}
P_{c} = \frac{\pi a^2}{4*\rho}\frac{1}{T}\int_{0}^{T}(\frac{dB}{dt})dt
\label{eq:EddyLoss3}
\end{equation}

Where a is the wire diameter. This equation was applied to the magnetic field vs rotor position data with time normalized so that eddy current loss in the wire at any rotational speed can be estimate by

\begin{equation}
Loss_{wire,eddy} = 0.00040681*f_{elec}^{2}
\label{eq:EddyLoss4}
\end{equation}

Where $Loss_{wire,eddy}$ is the total eddy current loss in the windings. At nominal motor operating conditions this predicts 228 watts of eddy current loss.


\section{Conclusions and Future Work}

Determining motor efficiency without precision input and output power measurement capabilities required higher order modeling to compensate for multiple loss sources. 
Testing at high powers on an open-air test stand also introduced additional confounding factors that were minimized through a combination of physical and operational controls.
Completion of these tests have sufficiently reduce uncertainty margins to pave the way for full vehicle integration and testing.
